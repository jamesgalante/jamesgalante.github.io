## Education

**University of Notre Dame**, Notre Dame, IN  
B.S. in Science-Computing  
Magna Cum Laude | GPA: 3.98/4.0

## Research Experience

### Life Science Research Professional
**Stanford University, Genetics Department**, Stanford, CA  
*Mentors: Dr. Jesse Engreitz and Dr. Lars Steinmetz*  
*August 2023 – Present*

- Evaluate machine learning models for enhancer mapping, focusing on optimizing high-throughput sequencing technologies to measure regulatory effects
- Collect and process all publicly available high-throughput CRISPRi screens targeting enhancers, assembling the largest dataset of non-coding perturbations to date
- Develop user-friendly pipelines to determine the statistical power of different sequencing technologies
- Analyze single cell perturbation datasets contributing to the ENCODE and IGVF consortia efforts
- Collaborate with labs at MIT, UCSF, EMBL, and Stanford to address limitations of CRISPR experiments

### Undergraduate Student Researcher
**University of Notre Dame, Department of Biological Sciences**, Notre Dame, IN  
*Mentor: Dr. Christopher Patzke*  
*July 2022 – August 2023*

- Researched genetic mechanisms of rare neurodevelopmental disorders through super-resolution imaging, NGS, and patient-derived neurons
- Analyzed the first RNA-Seq data from patient-derived neurons for Miller-Dieker Syndrome
- Reduced neuronal morphology analysis time from weeks to minutes using automated image analyses and C
- Processed external datasets including scRNA-Seq, temporal scATAC-Seq, and ChIP-Seq

### Undergraduate Student Researcher
**University of Notre Dame, Department of Applied & Comp. Mathematics and Statistics**, Notre Dame, IN  
*Mentor: Dr. Robert Rosenbaum*  
*August 2021 – May 2023*

- Analyzed neural networks to explore computational similarities with in vivo neuronal activity recordings
- Modified the Brainscore Python package to include model gradients in the scoring mechanism
- Explored contrastive learning techniques to refine representation spaces prior to classification

## Publications

## Projects

### Power Simulations Pipeline for Single Cell Perturbation Experiments
*April 2024 – November 2024*

- Developed a versatile pipeline to optimize cell numbers and design parameters for single-cell perturbation experiments
- Provided user-friendly simulations of effect sizes and cell counts for experimental biologists
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jamesgalante/Sceptre_Power_Simulations)

### scRNA-Seq Large Language Model Interpretation
*June 2023 – July 2023*

- Ablated attention heads in the scRNA-Seq LLM Geneformer to explore the localization of cell type-specific information
- Found that cell-type specific predictions relied on select specialized attention heads

### ASL Real-Time Computer Vision Model
*March 2022 – May 2022*

- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network for real-time ASL hand movement classification with >95% accuracy
- Utilized OpenCV, Google's MediaPipe Hands, and Python libraries for live prediction

## Leadership

### President, Echoes A Cappella
*June 2022 – May 2023*

- Directed a 20-member co-ed a cappella group, arranging and recording original music released on Spotify
- Managed logistics for travel and concerts, coordinated performances for charity events and competitions

### Choreographer, Keenan Revue
*December 2021 – February 2022*

- Choreographed dance performances for a renowned campus-wide annual variety show
- Directed over ninety people for performances attended by thousands
